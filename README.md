TimeOverflow Mobile App
=======================

This is an [Expo.io](https://expo.io) project.

1. Clone this repo and jump into the project folder:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:coopdevs/timeoverflow-mobile-app.git
$ cd timeoverflow-mobile-app
```

2. Install Expo's CLI node package:

$ npm install exp --global
```

3. Run Expo!

```

4. The previous command will output a QR code which will be used later to access the app from your phone. 

5. Install Expo's client on your phone: https://expo.io/tools#client
